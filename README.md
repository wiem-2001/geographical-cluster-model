# 📍 geographical-cluster-model
This project implements a machine learning model for clustering geographic coordinates based on on how close they are to one another.  Each resulting cluster represents a group of neighboring points

# 🚚 Delivery Use Case
This model was applied into a full-stack solution that visualizes delivery clusters and optimized routes on a map. Each cluster became a delivery route starting from a central warehouse (the user actual location), significantly improving route planning efficiency. You can explore the full project here:

# ⚙️ How It Works
Input: List of geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude)

Output: Cluster labels for each coordinate

Algorithm: K-Means a clustering algorithm that groups data points based on proximity and is well-suited for geographic data

Visualization: Leveraging Leaflet for real-time mapping of clusters and optimized delivery routes
